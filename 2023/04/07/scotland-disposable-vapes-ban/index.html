    <div class="post-body" itemprop="articleBody"><p>The Scottish government is set to review the use of disposable vapes, following concerns over their impact on the environment. The devices, which contain lithium batteries and plastic, are marketed as beginner-friendly and can last for the equivalent of a pack of 20 cigarettes. However, they are also considered an environmental threat due to littering and the difficulty in disposing of them properly. As a result, a potential ban on disposable vapes is being considered by the Scottish government. This article will explore the environmental concerns related to disposable vapes, the review being conducted by Zero Waste Scotland, and the potential implications of a ban on these products.</p>

<h2 id="The-Environmental-Impact-of-Disposable-Vapes"><a href="#The-Environmental-Impact-of-Disposable-Vapes" class="headerlink" title="The Environmental Impact of Disposable Vapes"></a>The Environmental Impact of Disposable Vapes</h2><p>Disposable vapes are single-use electronic cigarettes that are designed to be used once and then discarded. They are marketed as an alternative to traditional cigarettes and are often used by people who are trying to quit smoking. However, the convenience of these devices comes at a cost to the environment.</p>
<p>Because they contain valuable materials such as lithium batteries and copper, as well as plastic, vapes are classed as Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) and users are supposed to dispose of them at a household recycling centre or at the shop where they bought the device. Unfortunately, many people do not dispose of their vapes properly, leading to littering and environmental damage. The devices can take years to break down and can release harmful chemicals into the environment during that time.</p>
<h2 id="Disposable-Vapes-Review-by-Zero-Waste-Scotland"><a href="#Disposable-Vapes-Review-by-Zero-Waste-Scotland" class="headerlink" title="Disposable Vapes Review by Zero Waste Scotland"></a>Disposable Vapes Review by Zero Waste Scotland</h2><p>In response to concerns over the environmental impact of disposable vapes, Zero Waste Scotland will lead a review to consider international experience and action. The review will examine the impact of these products and consider potential solutions, such as increasing access to disposal options, improving product design, or launching publicity campaigns. A potential ban on disposable vapes will also be considered.</p>
<p>The Scottish government’s consideration of a ban on disposable vapes follows a consultation launched by the Irish government in October 2022. The Irish government cited concerns over littering and the wastefulness of these products as reasons for the consultation. If Scotland were to ban disposable vapes, it would join a growing number of countries and regions that have taken action to limit the use of these products.</p>
<h2 id="Implications-of-a-Ban-on-Disposable-Vapes"><a href="#Implications-of-a-Ban-on-Disposable-Vapes" class="headerlink" title="Implications of a Ban on Disposable Vapes"></a>Implications of a Ban on Disposable Vapes</h2><p>A ban on disposable vapes would have several implications for users, retailers, and manufacturers. Users would need to find alternative products, such as reusable or refillable devices. Retailers that currently sell disposable vapes would need to find alternative products to offer customers. Manufacturers would need to shift their focus to designing and producing reusable or refillable devices, rather than disposable ones.</p>
<p>While a ban on disposable vapes may have some negative consequences, it would also have several benefits. It would reduce littering and the environmental damage caused by these products. It would also encourage the use of more sustainable and environmentally friendly alternatives.</p>
<h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Disposable vapes have become a popular alternative to traditional cigarettes, but they come at a cost to the environment. The Scottish government’s consideration of a ban on these products is a response to concerns over littering and environmental damage. The review being conducted by Zero Waste Scotland will consider potential solutions, including a ban on disposable vapes, improved product design, and increased access to disposal options. While a ban on disposable vapes may have some negative consequences, it would also have several benefits, including reducing littering and encouraging the use of more sustainable alternatives.</p>
