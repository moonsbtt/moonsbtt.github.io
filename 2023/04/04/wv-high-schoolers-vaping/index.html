        <p>According to a recent study by Drug Watch, West Virginia has the highest rate of high school students who vape, at over 35%. This is significantly higher than the national average of 25% of high schoolers who vape. In this article, we will explore the reasons behind this alarming trend and its potential consequences.</p>
<p>The Target Market for Flavored E-Cigarettes<br>The study by Drug Watch suggests that young people are the target market for flavored e-cigarettes. These products are marketed as a safer alternative to traditional tobacco products like cigarettes. However, the long-term health effects of vaping are still largely unknown.</p>
<span id="more"></span>
<h2 id="Nationwide-Teen-Vaping-Trends"><a href="#Nationwide-Teen-Vaping-Trends" class="headerlink" title="Nationwide Teen Vaping Trends"></a>Nationwide Teen Vaping Trends</h2><p>The study found that 25% of high schoolers nationwide vape, compared to 6% of adults. The states with the highest rates of teen vaping are West Virginia at 35.7%, North Carolina at 35.5%, New Mexico at 34%, and New Hampshire at 33.8%.</p>
<h2 id="Adult-Tobacco-Use-in-West-Virginia"><a href="#Adult-Tobacco-Use-in-West-Virginia" class="headerlink" title="Adult Tobacco Use in West Virginia"></a>Adult Tobacco Use in West Virginia</h2><p>According to the West Virginia Division of Tobacco Prevention, West Virginia also has the highest percentage of adult tobacco use at 25.2%. This suggests that there is a culture of smoking and vaping in West Virginia that is difficult to break.</p>
<h2 id="Comparing-Vaping-to-Smoking"><a href="#Comparing-Vaping-to-Smoking" class="headerlink" title="Comparing Vaping to Smoking"></a>Comparing Vaping to Smoking</h2><p>While some argue that vaping is less harmful than traditional tobacco products, others believe that it is still a dangerous habit. One factor that complicates this issue is that West Virginia taxes cigarettes at a much higher rate than e-cigarettes. For example, a pack of cigarettes is taxed at $1.20, whereas 2 milliliters of vape liquid are taxed at only $0.15.</p>
<h2 id="Dangers-of-Laced-Vape-Products"><a href="#Dangers-of-Laced-Vape-Products" class="headerlink" title="Dangers of Laced Vape Products"></a>Dangers of Laced Vape Products</h2><p>One of the main concerns with vaping is the potential for laced products. Some vape liquids contain THC, the psychoactive component of marijuana, which can cause intoxication and other harmful effects. There has also been an uptick in the use of fentanyl, a powerful opioid, in recent years. This has led to an increased concern about the dangers of laced vape products.</p>
<h2 id="Recent-Incidents-in-West-Virginia-Schools"><a href="#Recent-Incidents-in-West-Virginia-Schools" class="headerlink" title="Recent Incidents in West Virginia Schools"></a>Recent Incidents in West Virginia Schools</h2><p>In recent years, there have been several incidents of students using laced vape products in West Virginia schools. In one instance, three students were caught using a THC vape at Mountaineer Middle School. They showed signs of being under the influence of narcotics and were sent to the hospital. Thankfully, the vape did not contain fentanyl.</p>
<p>In another incident, three students from Philip Barbour High School were hospitalized after having serious reactions to something. It is unclear if this was related to a vape device. In yet another incident, two students from Morgantown High School were hospitalized after using heroin-laced vape pens.</p>
<h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>The high rate of teen vaping in West Virginia is a concerning trend that has potential consequences for the health and well-being of young people in the state. The prevalence of flavored e-cigarettes and the culture of smoking and vaping in West Virginia make it difficult to combat this issue. The dangers of laced vape products, particularly those containing THC and fentanyl, further complicate the issue.</p>
