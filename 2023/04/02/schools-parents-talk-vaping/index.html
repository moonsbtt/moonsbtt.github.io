    <div class="post-body" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Vaping has become a growing concern among teenagers, with many schools reporting an increase in vaping-related incidents. As a result, schools and parents are seeking ways to address the problem effectively. In this article, we will discuss the dangers of vaping, what schools and students are saying about it, and how teachers and parents can talk to teenagers about it. We will also explore strategies that teachers can use to empower their students to make healthier choices.</p>
<span id="more"></span>
<h2 id="What-is-Vaping-and-Why-is-it-Dangerous"><a href="#What-is-Vaping-and-Why-is-it-Dangerous" class="headerlink" title="What is Vaping, and Why is it Dangerous?"></a>What is Vaping, and Why is it Dangerous?</h2><p>Vaping is the act of inhaling vapor produced by electronic cigarettes, or e-cigarettes. These devices are battery-powered and are designed to look like pens, USBs, or other small objects. The vapor is produced by heating a liquid cartridge, which contains a mixture of chemicals and flavorings. The vapor is then inhaled, along with potentially harmful chemicals and contaminants from the manufacturing process or the device itself.</p>
<p>Research shows that vaping can cause lung injury, cardiovascular disease, respiratory infections, and other serious negative effects. It can also lead to long-term addiction and is associated with other health risks such as seizures, acute nicotine toxicity, and burns. A single vape can contain as much nicotine as ten packets of cigarettes.</p>
<h2 id="What-Schools-are-Saying-About-Vaping"><a href="#What-Schools-are-Saying-About-Vaping" class="headerlink" title="What Schools are Saying About Vaping"></a>What Schools are Saying About Vaping</h2><p>According to a 2022 study, 32% of New South Wales teenagers aged between 14 and 17 years have tried vaping at least once. A 2017 national study found 13% of 12 to 17-year-olds had tried it. Schools across Australia are seeing an increase in vaping-related incidents, with some principals reporting hundreds of thousands of missed school days and an increase in expulsions due to vaping.</p>
<p>Schools know they have an important role to play in reducing the practice, but say punitive approaches are not helping students quit the habit. While some schools have resorted to locking up toilets to prevent vaping, this only causes addicted students to miss school to find somewhere else to vape. Some students are even being homeschooled so they can continue to vape.</p>
<h2 id="What-Students-are-Saying-About-Vaping"><a href="#What-Students-are-Saying-About-Vaping" class="headerlink" title="What Students are Saying About Vaping"></a>What Students are Saying About Vaping</h2><p>Our research suggests that while vaping is common among young people, they also understand that it is unsafe and unhealthy. In a survey of 2,777 students with an average age of 14, we found that 27% of students had vaped at least once before, with 37% of this group saying they do it several times a day. However, more than 96% of respondents said they believe vaping is unsafe and unhealthy, and 85% said it was “totally unsafe.”</p>
<p>Students also believe that more teenagers are vaping than there actually are, with over 60% agreeing that “most Australian teenagers vape.” Peer pressure is a factor, with respondents saying they would find it harder not to vape around friends. However, they also understand that they have the power to refuse to vape and need to be empowered to make healthier choices.</p>
<h2 id="How-to-Talk-to-Students-About-Vaping"><a href="#How-to-Talk-to-Students-About-Vaping" class="headerlink" title="How to Talk to Students About Vaping"></a>How to Talk to Students About Vaping</h2><p>Teachers and parents can play a vital role in helping young people avoid the serious harms associated with vaping. Here are some strategies that can be used:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Challenge the Idea That “Everyone is Doing It”</strong><br>Our research suggests that young people think more people vape than actually vape. If they are concerned about fitting in, they need to be given the facts.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Empower Young People to Say No to Vaping</strong><br>Young people need to know they can refuse to vape without being singled out. Examples of what they could say include “I don’t want to waste my money,” “I’ve seen those explode,” “I have asthma,” “I don’t want your germs,” or “Have you heard what kind of horrible things are in those?”</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Help Students Understand the Impact on Their Health</strong><br>It is essential to educate students about the negative impact of vaping on their health. This will enable them to make accurate choices about their well-being, rather than for what they think others want from them. Teachers can use different media elements like games, quizzes, videos to engage students rather than just lecturing them.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Don’t Preach, Use Interactive Tools</strong><br>Our research shows that teachers are seeing much better engagement when they use tools that include games, quizzes, videos, and different media elements rather than a lecture. If you are a teacher looking for ways to engage your students, our researchers have developed free games and a free online vaping module.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Create Supportive Environment</strong><br>Create a supportive environment at school or home. Encourage open communication with students to help them share their thoughts and feelings about vaping. Teachers and parents should create a supportive and non-judgmental environment to help students deal with vaping addiction.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="FAQs"><a href="#FAQs" class="headerlink" title="FAQs"></a>FAQs</h2><ul>
<li><p><strong>How Can Parents Help Their Children Avoid Vaping?</strong><br>Parents can help their children avoid vaping by having open communication with them, creating a supportive environment, and educating them about the dangers of vaping.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Why is Vaping So Addictive?</strong><br>Vaping is addictive because it contains nicotine, which is a highly addictive substance. Nicotine can rewire the brain’s reward system, making it difficult for people to quit.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Are There Any Alternatives to Vaping?</strong><br>There are many alternatives to vaping, including nicotine gum, patches, and lozenges. Counseling and support groups can also help people quit vaping.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>How Can Schools Deal With Vaping-Related Incidents?</strong><br>Schools can deal with vaping-related incidents by adopting a supportive and non-judgmental approach. Teachers should educate students about the dangers of vaping and create a supportive environment to help them deal with addiction.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Can Vaping Cause Lung Cancer?</strong><br>Research suggests that vaping can cause lung cancer, although more studies are needed to fully understand the long-term effects of vaping on health.</p>
</li>
