        <p>Adding mint flavor to e-cigarette liquids may seem harmless, but it can actually be detrimental to your health. Researchers from the University of Pittsburgh have found that adding menthol to e-cigarette liquids produces more vapor particles, leading to worse lung function in those who smoke.</p>
<p>In this article, we’ll dive into the details of the study, including the robotic system that was used to mimic human breathing and vaping behavior, the dangers of menthol vapers, and the limitations of traditional toxicity testing. We’ll also discuss the importance of understanding the risks and benefits of e-cigarettes before trying them.</p>

    <div class="e-content article-entry" itemprop="articleBody">
      
        <p>New vape sensors are set to be installed in all high school bathrooms in Limestone County for the next academic year. This move follows a successful pilot program conducted two years ago at West Limestone High School, where more than 200 vapes were detected during the program’s lifespan. The school board approved the installation of more sensors to curb the epidemic of vaping among students, which poses a danger to their health and wellbeing.</p>
<p>The school principal, Russ Cleveland, stated that the installation of the sensors would serve as a deterrent to students. “It is an epidemic that a lot of people don’t think about. It can endanger our students, so we’re trying to remove it any way we can,” he said. The HALO Smart Sensor will be attached to the bathroom’s ceiling and looks like a smoke detector. The sensor will examine aerosol particles in the air and will alert staff via phone and email when it detects the specific vape chemical particles in the air. The sensor is so sensitive that it will let staff know what exactly it detected and whether it has THC in it.</p>

        <p>The UK government has announced a new world-first health initiative to encourage up to one million British smokers to switch from cigarettes to vapes. Pregnant women will be offered financial incentives to make the change as part of the government’s target to reduce the number of smokers to 5 per cent or less of the population. The scheme will give almost one in five smokers a vape starter kit, along with support to quit smoking.</p>
<p>In a speech, Health Minister Neil O’Brien highlighted the dangers of smoking, saying, “Up to two-out-of-three lifelong smokers will die from smoking. Cigarettes are the only product on sale which will kill you if used correctly.” The government will fund a new national “swap to stop” scheme, the first of its kind in the world.</p>

        <p>The Scottish government is set to review the use of disposable vapes, following concerns over their impact on the environment. The devices, which contain lithium batteries and plastic, are marketed as beginner-friendly and can last for the equivalent of a pack of 20 cigarettes. However, they are also considered an environmental threat due to littering and the difficulty in disposing of them properly. As a result, a potential ban on disposable vapes is being considered by the Scottish government. This article will explore the environmental concerns related to disposable vapes, the review being conducted by Zero Waste Scotland, and the potential implications of a ban on these products.</p>

        <p>Alabama lawmakers have taken a step forward with proposed legislation that would make smoking or vaping in a car with a child under the age of 14 a punishable offense. The proposed law, HB3, would carry a penalty of up to $100 for each violation and is considered a secondary offense in the state.</p>
<p>Representative Rolanda Hollis, the bill’s sponsor, said the goal is to protect children from the harmful effects of secondhand smoke. She first introduced a similar bill in 2018, but the updated version includes a prohibition on vaping specifically.</p>
<p>“It’s different, but it can still have an effect,” Hollis said regarding the distinction between cigarettes and vaping. “Smoke is smoke.”</p>
<p>Here’s what you need to know about this proposed legislation and its potential impact on Alabamians.</p>

        <p>Vaping has become increasingly popular in recent years, with more than 5.6 million American adults using electronic devices to inhale nicotine and flavored vapors. However, just like cigarette smoking, vaping can quickly become a habit that is tough to quit. Fortunately, researchers are now conducting a clinical trial of a plant-based product that has been tested on cigarette smokers to see if it can help people hooked on vaping.</p>
<p>In this article, we will discuss the new treatment for quitting vaping, Cytisinicline, including its effectiveness, side effects, and how it compares to other smoking cessation medicines.</p>

    <div class="e-content article-entry" itemprop="articleBody">
      
        <p>The United States Congress has recently proposed a legislative act that would put an end to the ability of e-cigarette and tobacco manufacturers to claim federal tax deductions for advertising expenses. The No Tax Subsidies for E-Cigarette and Tobacco Ads Act, reintroduced by Senators Jeanne Shaheen and Richard Blumenthal, would not make the direct-to-consumer ads illegal, but would put an end to the tax deductions that the companies are currently entitled to for advertising expenses related to vaping and other tobacco products.</p>
<p>This move comes amid growing concerns over the use of e-cigarettes among minors, and the marketing tactics employed by the e-cigarette industry. In recent years, e-cigarette use among teenagers has skyrocketed, with the National Youth Tobacco Survey reporting that 27.5% of high school students and 10.5% of middle school students used e-cigarettes in 2019.</p>
