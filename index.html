    </h1>
  

      </header>
    
    <div class="e-content article-entry" itemprop="articleBody">
      
        <p>Alabama lawmakers have taken a step forward with proposed legislation that would make smoking or vaping in a car with a child under the age of 14 a punishable offense. The proposed law, HB3, would carry a penalty of up to $100 for each violation and is considered a secondary offense in the state.</p>
<p>Representative Rolanda Hollis, the bill’s sponsor, said the goal is to protect children from the harmful effects of secondhand smoke. She first introduced a similar bill in 2018, but the updated version includes a prohibition on vaping specifically.</p>
<p>“It’s different, but it can still have an effect,” Hollis said regarding the distinction between cigarettes and vaping. “Smoke is smoke.”</p>
<p>Here’s what you need to know about this proposed legislation and its potential impact on Alabamians.</p>
<h2 id="The-proposed-ban-on-smoking-and-vaping-in-vehicles-with-children"><a href="#The-proposed-ban-on-smoking-and-vaping-in-vehicles-with-children" class="headerlink" title="The proposed ban on smoking and vaping in vehicles with children"></a>The proposed ban on smoking and vaping in vehicles with children</h2><p>The proposed law would make it illegal for drivers or passengers to smoke or vape in a car when a child under the age of 14 is present. The law is considered a secondary offense, which means a person cannot be pulled over solely for breaking this law.</p>
<p>However, if a person is pulled over for another violation, such as speeding or running a red light, and is found to be smoking or vaping with a child in the car, they can be fined up to $100.</p>
<h2 id="The-health-effects-of-secondhand-smoke"><a href="#The-health-effects-of-secondhand-smoke" class="headerlink" title="The health effects of secondhand smoke"></a>The health effects of secondhand smoke</h2><p>Secondhand smoke is a serious health hazard, particularly for children who are still developing. Children who are exposed to secondhand smoke are at higher risk for sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), asthma, bronchitis, and pneumonia.</p>
<p>According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), there is no safe level of exposure to secondhand smoke. Even brief exposure can be harmful to health.</p>
<h2 id="Why-the-bill-includes-a-prohibition-on-vaping"><a href="#Why-the-bill-includes-a-prohibition-on-vaping" class="headerlink" title="Why the bill includes a prohibition on vaping"></a>Why the bill includes a prohibition on vaping</h2><p>While smoking and vaping may seem like different activities, they both involve inhaling harmful chemicals into the lungs. Secondhand smoke from traditional cigarettes contains over 7,000 chemicals, many of which are known to cause cancer.</p>
<p>Similarly, secondhand vapor from e-cigarettes and other vaping devices contains harmful chemicals, including nicotine, formaldehyde, and heavy metals like lead and nickel.</p>
<p>Vaping has also been linked to an increased risk of respiratory infections and other health problems, particularly in children.</p>
<h2 id="What-supporters-say"><a href="#What-supporters-say" class="headerlink" title="What supporters say"></a>What supporters say</h2><p>Supporters of the proposed law say that it’s important to protect children from the harmful effects of secondhand smoke and vapor. Children who are exposed to secondhand smoke are more likely to develop asthma, respiratory infections, and other health problems.</p>
<p>They also argue that smoking or vaping in a car with a child is a form of child abuse, as it puts the child’s health and safety at risk.</p>
<h2 id="What-opponents-say"><a href="#What-opponents-say" class="headerlink" title="What opponents say"></a>What opponents say</h2><p>Opponents of the proposed law argue that it’s an infringement on personal freedom and the right to make choices about one’s own health. They also say that it’s difficult to enforce, as police officers may have difficulty determining whether someone was smoking or vaping in a car with a child present.</p>
<p>The potential impact on Alabama residents<br>If the proposed law is passed by the Senate and signed into law by the governor, it will be illegal to smoke or vape in a car with a child under the age of 14 present. Violators could be fined up to $100 per violation.</p>
<p>The law is designed to protect children from the harmful effects of secondhand smoke and vapor, which can cause a range of health problems.</p>
<h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>The proposed legislation in Alabama to ban smoking and vaping in vehicles with children is a step towards protecting children from the dangers of secondhand smoke and vapor. Secondhand smoke has been linked to a range of health problems, particularly in children, and the proposed law aims to reduce their exposure to these harmful chemicals While opponents of the proposed law argue that it infringes on personal freedom, supporters argue that it’s a form of child abuse to expose children to secondhand smoke and vapor.</p>
<p>If the law is passed, Alabama would join a growing list of states and countries that have enacted similar legislation to protect children from the harmful effects of secondhand smoke and vapor.</p>

This is significantly higher than the national average of 25% of high schoolers who vape. In this article, we will explore the reasons behind this alarming trend and its potential consequences.</p>
<p>The Target Market for Flavored E-Cigarettes<br>The study by Drug Watch suggests that young people are the target market for flavored e-cigarettes.

        <p>Vaping has become increasingly popular in recent years, with more than 5.6 million American adults using electronic devices to inhale nicotine and flavored vapors. However, just like cigarette smoking, vaping can quickly become a habit that is tough to quit. Fortunately, researchers are now conducting a clinical trial of a plant-based product that has been tested on cigarette smokers to see if it can help people hooked on vaping.</p>
<p>In this article, we will discuss the new treatment for quitting vaping, Cytisinicline, including its effectiveness, side effects, and how it compares to other smoking cessation medicines.</p>

    <div class="e-content article-entry" itemprop="articleBody">
      
        <p>The United States Congress has recently proposed a legislative act that would put an end to the ability of e-cigarette and tobacco manufacturers to claim federal tax deductions for advertising expenses. The No Tax Subsidies for E-Cigarette and Tobacco Ads Act, reintroduced by Senators Jeanne Shaheen and Richard Blumenthal, would not make the direct-to-consumer ads illegal, but would put an end to the tax deductions that the companies are currently entitled to for advertising expenses related to vaping and other tobacco products.</p>
<p>This move comes amid growing concerns over the use of e-cigarettes among minors, and the marketing tactics employed by the e-cigarette industry. In recent years, e-cigarette use among teenagers has skyrocketed, with the National Youth Tobacco Survey reporting that 27.5% of high school students and 10.5% of middle school students used e-cigarettes in 2019.</p>
