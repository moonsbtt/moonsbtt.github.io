    </h1>
  

      </header>
    
    <div class="e-content article-entry" itemprop="articleBody">
      
        <p>Alabama lawmakers have taken a step forward with proposed legislation that would make smoking or vaping in a car with a child under the age of 14 a punishable offense. The proposed law, HB3, would carry a penalty of up to $100 for each violation and is considered a secondary offense in the state.</p>
<p>Representative Rolanda Hollis, the bill’s sponsor, said the goal is to protect children from the harmful effects of secondhand smoke. She first introduced a similar bill in 2018, but the updated version includes a prohibition on vaping specifically.</p>
<p>“It’s different, but it can still have an effect,” Hollis said regarding the distinction between cigarettes and vaping. “Smoke is smoke.”</p>
<p>Here’s what you need to know about this proposed legislation and its potential impact on Alabamians.</p>
<h2 id="The-proposed-ban-on-smoking-and-vaping-in-vehicles-with-children"><a href="#The-proposed-ban-on-smoking-and-vaping-in-vehicles-with-children" class="headerlink" title="The proposed ban on smoking and vaping in vehicles with children"></a>The proposed ban on smoking and vaping in vehicles with children</h2><p>The proposed law would make it illegal for drivers or passengers to smoke or vape in a car when a child under the age of 14 is present. The law is considered a secondary offense, which means a person cannot be pulled over solely for breaking this law.</p>
<p>However, if a person is pulled over for another violation, such as speeding or running a red light, and is found to be smoking or vaping with a child in the car, they can be fined up to $100.</p>
<h2 id="The-health-effects-of-secondhand-smoke"><a href="#The-health-effects-of-secondhand-smoke" class="headerlink" title="The health effects of secondhand smoke"></a>The health effects of secondhand smoke</h2><p>Secondhand smoke is a serious health hazard, particularly for children who are still developing. Children who are exposed to secondhand smoke are at higher risk for sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), asthma, bronchitis, and pneumonia.</p>
<p>According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), there is no safe level of exposure to secondhand smoke. Even brief exposure can be harmful to health.</p>
<h2 id="Why-the-bill-includes-a-prohibition-on-vaping"><a href="#Why-the-bill-includes-a-prohibition-on-vaping" class="headerlink" title="Why the bill includes a prohibition on vaping"></a>Why the bill includes a prohibition on vaping</h2><p>While smoking and vaping may seem like different activities, they both involve inhaling harmful chemicals into the lungs. Secondhand smoke from traditional cigarettes contains over 7,000 chemicals, many of which are known to cause cancer.</p>
<p>Similarly, secondhand vapor from e-cigarettes and other vaping devices contains harmful chemicals, including nicotine, formaldehyde, and heavy metals like lead and nickel.</p>
<p>Vaping has also been linked to an increased risk of respiratory infections and other health problems, particularly in children.</p>
<h2 id="What-supporters-say"><a href="#What-supporters-say" class="headerlink" title="What supporters say"></a>What supporters say</h2><p>Supporters of the proposed law say that it’s important to protect children from the harmful effects of secondhand smoke and vapor. Children who are exposed to secondhand smoke are more likely to develop asthma, respiratory infections, and other health problems.</p>
<p>They also argue that smoking or vaping in a car with a child is a form of child abuse, as it puts the child’s health and safety at risk.</p>
<h2 id="What-opponents-say"><a href="#What-opponents-say" class="headerlink" title="What opponents say"></a>What opponents say</h2><p>Opponents of the proposed law argue that it’s an infringement on personal freedom and the right to make choices about one’s own health. They also say that it’s difficult to enforce, as police officers may have difficulty determining whether someone was smoking or vaping in a car with a child present.</p>
<p>The potential impact on Alabama residents<br>If the proposed law is passed by the Senate and signed into law by the governor, it will be illegal to smoke or vape in a car with a child under the age of 14 present. Violators could be fined up to $100 per violation.</p>
<p>The law is designed to protect children from the harmful effects of secondhand smoke and vapor, which can cause a range of health problems.</p>
<h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>The proposed legislation in Alabama to ban smoking and vaping in vehicles with children is a step towards protecting children from the dangers of secondhand smoke and vapor. Secondhand smoke has been linked to a range of health problems, particularly in children, and the proposed law aims to reduce their exposure to these harmful chemicals While opponents of the proposed law argue that it infringes on personal freedom, supporters argue that it’s a form of child abuse to expose children to secondhand smoke and vapor.</p>
<p>If the law is passed, Alabama would join a growing list of states and countries that have enacted similar legislation to protect children from the harmful effects of secondhand smoke and vapor.</p>

<p>The Target Market for Flavored E-Cigarettes<br>The study by Drug Watch suggests that young people are the target market for flavored e-cigarettes.

        <p>Vaping has become increasingly popular in recent years, with more than 5.6 million American adults using electronic devices to inhale nicotine and flavored vapors. However, just like cigarette smoking, vaping can quickly become a habit that is tough to quit. Fortunately, researchers are now conducting a clinical trial of a plant-based product that has been tested on cigarette smokers to see if it can help people hooked on vaping.</p>
<p>In this article, we will discuss the new treatment for quitting vaping, Cytisinicline, including its effectiveness, side effects, and how it compares to other smoking cessation medicines.</p>

      </header>
    
    <div class="e-content article-entry" itemprop="articleBody">
      
        <p>The United States Congress has recently proposed a legislative act that would put an end to the ability of e-cigarette and tobacco manufacturers to claim federal tax deductions for advertising expenses. The No Tax Subsidies for E-Cigarette and Tobacco Ads Act, reintroduced by Senators Jeanne Shaheen and Richard Blumenthal, would not make the direct-to-consumer ads illegal, but would put an end to the tax deductions that the companies are currently entitled to for advertising expenses related to vaping and other tobacco products.</p>
<p>This move comes amid growing concerns over the use of e-cigarettes among minors, and the marketing tactics employed by the e-cigarette industry. In recent years, e-cigarette use among teenagers has skyrocketed, with the National Youth Tobacco Survey reporting that 27.5% of high school students and 10.5% of middle school students used e-cigarettes in 2019.</p>

    </h1>
  

      </header>
    
    <div class="e-content article-entry" itemprop="articleBody">
      
        <p>Vaping has become a growing concern among teenagers, with many schools reporting an increase in vaping-related incidents. As a result, schools and parents are seeking ways to address the problem effectively. In this article, we will discuss the dangers of vaping, what schools and students are saying about it, and how teachers and parents can talk to teenagers about it. We will also explore strategies that teachers can use to empower their students to make healthier choices.</p>
<h2 id="What-is-Vaping-and-Why-is-it-Dangerous"><a href="#What-is-Vaping-and-Why-is-it-Dangerous" class="headerlink" title="What is Vaping, and Why is it Dangerous?"></a>What is Vaping, and Why is it Dangerous?</h2><p>Vaping is the act of inhaling vapor produced by electronic cigarettes, or e-cigarettes. These devices are battery-powered and are designed to look like pens, USBs, or other small objects. The vapor is produced by heating a liquid cartridge, which contains a mixture of chemicals and flavorings. The vapor is then inhaled, along with potentially harmful chemicals and contaminants from the manufacturing process or the device itself.</p>
<p>Research shows that vaping can cause lung injury, cardiovascular disease, respiratory infections, and other serious negative effects. It can also lead to long-term addiction and is associated with other health risks such as seizures, acute nicotine toxicity, and burns. A single vape can contain as much nicotine as ten packets of cigarettes.</p>
<h2 id="What-Schools-are-Saying-About-Vaping"><a href="#What-Schools-are-Saying-About-Vaping" class="headerlink" title="What Schools are Saying About Vaping"></a>What Schools are Saying About Vaping</h2><p>According to a 2022 study, 32% of New South Wales teenagers aged between 14 and 17 years have tried vaping at least once. A 2017 national study found 13% of 12 to 17-year-olds had tried it. Schools across Australia are seeing an increase in vaping-related incidents, with some principals reporting hundreds of thousands of missed school days and an increase in expulsions due to vaping.</p>
<p>Schools know they have an important role to play in reducing the practice, but say punitive approaches are not helping students quit the habit. While some schools have resorted to locking up toilets to prevent vaping, this only causes addicted students to miss school to find somewhere else to vape. Some students are even being homeschooled so they can continue to vape.</p>
<h2 id="What-Students-are-Saying-About-Vaping"><a href="#What-Students-are-Saying-About-Vaping" class="headerlink" title="What Students are Saying About Vaping"></a>What Students are Saying About Vaping</h2><p>Our research suggests that while vaping is common among young people, they also understand that it is unsafe and unhealthy. In a survey of 2,777 students with an average age of 14, we found that 27% of students had vaped at least once before, with 37% of this group saying they do it several times a day. However, more than 96% of respondents said they believe vaping is unsafe and unhealthy, and 85% said it was “totally unsafe.”</p>
<p>Students also believe that more teenagers are vaping than there actually are, with over 60% agreeing that “most Australian teenagers vape.” Peer pressure is a factor, with respondents saying they would find it harder not to vape around friends. However, they also understand that they have the power to refuse to vape and need to be empowered to make healthier choices.</p>
<h2 id="How-to-Talk-to-Students-About-Vaping"><a href="#How-to-Talk-to-Students-About-Vaping" class="headerlink" title="How to Talk to Students About Vaping"></a>How to Talk to Students About Vaping</h2><p>Teachers and parents can play a vital role in helping young people avoid the serious harms associated with vaping. Here are some strategies that can be used:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Challenge the Idea That “Everyone is Doing It”</strong><br>Our research suggests that young people think more people vape than actually vape. If they are concerned about fitting in, they need to be given the facts.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Empower Young People to Say No to Vaping</strong><br>Young people need to know they can refuse to vape without being singled out. Examples of what they could say include “I don’t want to waste my money,” “I’ve seen those explode,” “I have asthma,” “I don’t want your germs,” or “Have you heard what kind of horrible things are in those?”</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Help Students Understand the Impact on Their Health</strong><br>It is essential to educate students about the negative impact of vaping on their health. This will enable them to make accurate choices about their well-being, rather than for what they think others want from them. Teachers can use different media elements like games, quizzes, videos to engage students rather than just lecturing them.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Don’t Preach, Use Interactive Tools</strong><br>Our research shows that teachers are seeing much better engagement when they use tools that include games, quizzes, videos, and different media elements rather than a lecture. If you are a teacher looking for ways to engage your students, our researchers have developed free games and a free online vaping module.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Create Supportive Environment</strong><br>Create a supportive environment at school or home. Encourage open communication with students to help them share their thoughts and feelings about vaping. Teachers and parents should create a supportive and non-judgmental environment to help students deal with vaping addiction.</p>
</li>
